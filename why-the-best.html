    <h3 class="firstH"> Performance and Power </h3>
    <p> The McLaren 765LT Spider is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 
        engine producing 765 PS (755 hp) and 800 Nm (590 lb-ft) of torque. It 
        accelerates from 0-100 km/h in 2.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 205 mph.
        The car's lightweight construction and optimized gear ratios contribute to its
        impressive power-to-weight ratio of 622 PS per tonne, resulting in exceptional
        performance metrics across the board. </p>
    <h3> Engineering and Design </h3>
    <p> Engineered for lightness and aerodynamics, the 765LT Spider is 80 kg lighter 
        than the 720S Spider. Extensive use of carbon fiber and a minimalist design
        approach enhance handling and responsiveness. The bespoke carbon fiber body
        increases downforce by 25% compared to the 720S, improving high-speed stability
        and overall performance. </p>

         Its mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout provides dynamic balance and precise
         handling. The electro-hydraulic steering, stiff engine mounts, and reduced
         sound deadening allow drivers to fully experience the car's performance.
         The quad-exit titanium exhaust creates a symphonic soundtrack that enthusiasts
         cherish. </p>
    <h3> Exclusive Features </h3>
    <p> Limited to 765 units, the 765LT Spider boasts exclusive features like
        an electric retractable hardtop that opens in 11 seconds. The interior
        is designed for driver engagement, featuring lightweight materials and
        functional design elements that enhance the overall driving experience. </p>
