    <h1>History</h1>

    <h3>1. The Origins of the Longtail Concept</h3>
    <p>
        The "Longtail" name originated in 1997 with the McLaren F1 GTR Longtail,
         a race car designed for the FIA GT Championship.
         Its elongated body improved aerodynamics, allowing for higher speeds.
         This model established a legacy of performance and engineering excellence
         that would influence future McLaren vehicles,
         setting the stage for the Longtail variants to come.</p>

    <h3>2. The Modern Longtail Revival</h3>

    <p>In 2015, McLaren revived the Longtail concept with the 675LT, based on the 650S.
         This model featured a more powerful 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 engine and significant
         weight reduction through carbon fiber construction. With enhanced aerodynamics
         and only 500 units produced, the 675LT created a sense of exclusivity and set
         a new benchmark for McLaren's performance-focused lineup.</p>

    <h3>3. The 765LT Spider Development</h3>
    
   
    <p>The 765LT coupe was unveiled in 2020, featuring a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine
         that produced 765 PS (755 hp) and was 80 kg lighter than the 720S. 
         Following its success, the 765LT Spider was introduced in 2021 as a convertible 
         variant, complete with a lightweight retractable hard top that opens in just 11
          seconds. Limited to 765 units, the Spider maintained nearly identical performance
           to the coupe, solidifying its status as a premier supercar and continuing the
            Longtail legacy.</p>
